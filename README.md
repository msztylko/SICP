## Scheme Installation
To run Scheme interpreter on Mac M1 with ARM silicon the best tool I've found is [Gambit Scheme](https://gambitscheme.org/) as it's readily available on Homebrew. To install it, simply run `brew install gambit-scheme`

### Jupyter
For using Scheme in Jupyter Notebook I've used [Calysto Scheme](https://github.com/Calysto/calysto_scheme)

## [Procedures and the Processes They Generate](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#footnote_Temp_48:~:text=Procedures%20and%20the%20Processes%20They%20Generate)

Great explanation of recursive procedures vs recursive processes, illustrated with factorial function. 

### Recursive procedure, recursive process

```python
def factorial1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial1(n-1)
```

* recursive procedure - factorial1 calls itself in the definition
* recursive process - chain of deferred operations, interpreter keeps track of operations to be performed later

### Recursive procedure, iterative process

```python
def factorial2(n):
    def factorial(product, counter, max_count):
        if counter > max_count:
            return product
        else:
            return factorial(product * counter, counter + 1, max_count)
            
    return factorial(1, 1, n)    
```

* recursive procedure - factorial calls itself in the definition
* iterative process - state can be summarized by state variables (product, counter, max_count) that we pass from one state to the next

### Iterative procedure, iterative process

```python
def factorial3(n):
    product = 1
    counter = 1
    max_count = n
    
    while counter <= max_count:
        product *= counter
        counter += 1
    
    return product
```

* iterative process - no self-reference in the function definition, use of "looping construct" (while)
* iterative process - state summarized by fixed number of state variables

### Fibonacci numbers example

Recursive process

```scheme
(define (fib1 n)
    (cond ((= n 0) 0)
          ((= n 1) 1)
          (else (+ (fib1 (- n 1))
                   (fib1 (- n 2))))))
```

Iterative process

```scheme
(define (fib2 n)
    (define (fib-iter a b count)
        (if (= count 0)
            b
            (fib-iter (+ a b) a (- count 1))))
    
    (fib-iter 1 0 n))
```

## [Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-12.html#%_sec_1.3)

Many similar procedures like:

```scheme
(define (sum-integers a b)
    (if (> a b)
    0
    (+ a (sum-integers (+ a 1) b))))
    
(define (sum-cubes a b)
    (if (> a b)
    0
    (+ (cube a) (sum-cubes (+ a 1) b))))
```

can be defined in terms of the pattern they share:

```scheme
(define (sum term a next b)
    (if (> a b)
        0
        (+ (term a)
           (sum term (next a) next b))))      
```

Procedure for summing cubes can now be rewritten as:

```scheme
(define (sum-cubes a b)
    (sum cube a inc b))
    
(define (inc n) (+ n 1))
```

However, `sum` procedure is only one example of this class of functions. Another example:

```scheme
(define (product term a next b)
    (if (> a b)
        1
        (* (term a)
           (product term (next a) next b))))
```

Here, we can again see many similarities between these procedures. In the same way as `sum-integers` and `sum-cubes` are just special cases of a more general procedure `sum`, `sum` and `product` can be viewed as special cases of a more general procedure `accumulate`:

```scheme
(define (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
  (if (> a b)
      null-value
      (combiner (term a)
                (accumulate combiner null-value term (next a) next b))))
```
See [ex1.32](./chapter1/ch1.3/ex1.32.scm) for comaprison of recursive and iterative `accumulate`

Defining procedure as a special cases of some more abstract (higher-order) procedure is possible thanks to **first-class functions**.

Once we have higher-order function that operate on other procedures we frequently need to define smaller, helper procedures like:
```scheme
(define (inc n) (+ n 1))
```
It's not very convenient to create a new procedure for simplest operations like increment and that's why **anonymous procedures** become useful:
```scheme
(lambda (n) (+ n 1))
```

## [What Is Meant by Data?](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-14.html#%_sec_2.1.3)

Data can be defined in terms of its behaviour specified by constructor (`make-rational`) and selectors (`nominator`, `denominator`):

```scheme
(define x (make-rational n d))

(= (/ (numer x) (denom x)) (/ n d))
```

in a simlar way we can define `cons`, `car` and `cdr` by its behaviour:

```scheme
(define z (cons x y))
(= (car z) x)
(= (cdr z) y)
```

We can implement such behaviour without any data structures, only using prodecures:

```scheme
(define (cons x y)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((= m 0) x)
          ((= m 1) y)
          (else (error "Argument not 0 or 1 -- CONS" m))))
  dispatch)

(define (car z) (z 0))

(define (cdr z) (z 1))
```

**Data** can be implemented in terms of **procedures**.
